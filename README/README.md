#Post-Conflict Transitional Justice Mechanisms, 1946-2006

###Motivation
This application aims to help transitional justice scholars identify post-conflict transitional justice (PCJ) mechanisms from 1946-2006 based on their distinct characteristics, in order to gain a more thorough understanding of how, where, and under what conditions trials, truth commissions, reparations, and so forth have been implemented following a period of conflict. Users will be able to examine PCJ mechanismsand their unique characteristics by being able to create a customizable data table to fit specific parameters and then download the table for their use. This project was inspired by the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program]("http://ucdp.uu.se/") with the [Peace Research Institute in Oslo] ("https://www.prio.org/") which allows users to explore different past and ongoing conflicts around the world. Ultimately, this app is meant to make data (which is publicly available) easier to understand in an interactive environment.
