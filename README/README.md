#Post-Conflict Transitional Justice Mechanisms, 1946-2006
####Sofía Corzo

###Motivation

This application aims to help transitional justice scholars identify post-conflict transitional justice (PCJ) mechanisms from 1946-2006 based on their distinct characteristics, in order to gain a more thorough understanding of how, where, and under what conditions trials, truth commissions, reparations, and so forth have been implemented following a period of conflict. Users will be able to examine PCJ mechanisms and their unique characteristics by being able to create a customizable data table to fit specific parameters and then download the table for their use. This project was inspired by the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program]("http://ucdp.uu.se/") with the [Peace Research Institute in Oslo]("https://www.prio.org/") which allows users to explore different past and ongoing conflicts around the world. Ultimately, this app is meant to make data (which is publicly available) easier to understand in an interactive environment.

###Background Information

Transitional justice refers to processes that arise after periods of severe human rights violations and repression, usually (but not always) in the context of internal armed conflicts. Some of the guiding principles of transitional justice are accountability, redress for victims, restoring confidence in institutions, looking for long-lasting resolutions to conflicts, and fostering reconciliation.

###Specifications and Limitations

The PCJ dataset has been coded very specifically, so I recommend anyone that wants to explore this dataset further to read the [PCJ Codebook]("http://www.justice-data.com/pcj-dataset/PCJ%20codebook%20-%20Binningsb%C3%B8%20et%20al%20JPR_49(5).pdf"), which includes the PRIO’s rationale for coding some conflicts or mechanisms in a certain way. **The PRIO defines a “conflict” as any episode with at least 25 annual battle-related deaths, and any “post-conflict” period as the period lasting up to five years after the end of an internal armed conflict.** Furthermore, while the mechanisms explored in this tab are the most common, there are other ways societies have 
reckoned following periods of conflict, which aren't included here, such as memorials, certain works of art, 
public service works, and more. This app is not meant to be exhaustive on all actions inspired by the ideals usually espoused in transitional justice, or all actions by civil society and government to deal with a difficult past. Most importantly, this app is not meant to be taken as a way to explore the causal relationships between a conflict’s characteristics and its PCJ mechanisms, but to make the most usual PCJ mechanisms easier to identify, explore, and use in other analyses.
